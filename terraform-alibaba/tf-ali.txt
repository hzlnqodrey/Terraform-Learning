Authentication [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aliyun/alicloud/latest/docs#authentication]

    The Alicloud provider accepts several ways to enter credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:
        • Static credentials
            Static credentials can be provided by adding access_key, secret_key and region in-line in the alicloud provider block:
                provider "alicloud" {
                    access_key = "${var.access_key}"
                    secret_key = "${var.secret_key}"
                    region     = "${var.region}"
                }    
        
        • Environment variables
            You can provide your credentials via ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY and ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY environment variables, representing your Alicloud access key and secret key respectively. ALICLOUD_REGION is also used, if applicable:
                Block:
                    provider "alicloud" {}
                CLI:
                    $ export ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY="access-key"
                    $ export ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY="secret-key"
                    $ export ALICLOUD_REGION="sea-jakarta"
                    $ terraform plan
